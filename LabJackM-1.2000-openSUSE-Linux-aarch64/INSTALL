===========
LJM Install
===========

To install the LabJackM (LJM) driver/library, run the LabJackM.run script
located in this directory:

  $ sudo ./LabJackM.run


LabJackM.run will copy all .so library files to the correct locations, set up
device rule files, and set permissions.

Additionally, LabJackM.run will create a directory named LabJackM,
which contains all of the files that were installed, as well as some example
programs in LabJackM/examples and a local copy of SCons
(http://www.scons.org/).


LabJackM.run is a Makeself script. For more information, see
